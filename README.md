# Exploring the Impact of Cache Replacement Policies on System Performance: A Gem5 Simulation Approach

Instructions to run the project

* Build the gem6 for x86 microprocessor
* Place each of these files in the specific folders or edit the paths in required places
* `caches_level.py` --> `gem5/configs/learning_gem5/part1/`
* `three_level_cache.py` --> `gem5/configs/learning_gem5/part1/`
*  `benchmarks/` --> `gem5/configs/learning_gem5/part1/`
*  `run_script.sh` --> `gem5/`
*  `result_analysis.ipynb` --> Place it in thw folder you get your output or refernece the resultant `output.txt` and `output.csv` from within the python notebook to create visualization and analyze the results.
